Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in the garden with her dog, Max. One sunny day, Lily found a beautiful butterfly.

"Look, Max!" she said. "Isn't it pretty?"

The butterfly flew away, and Lily chased it through the flowers. She laughed and played until the sun went down.

Tom was a curious boy who loved to explore. One day, he found an old map in his grandfather's attic.

"What's this?" he wondered.

The map showed a path to a hidden treasure in the woods behind his house.
